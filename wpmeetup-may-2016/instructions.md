#### First Things First

1. What is a WordPress theme?

2. Resources for learning theme devlelopment
 * [Theme Handbook &raquo; Theme Basics](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/)
 * Learn from high-quality existing themes
3. Basic Terminology
 * [Template Files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/)
 * [Template Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-tags/)
